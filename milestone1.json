  "Milestone 1 - Understanding Open Networks": {
    "Intro Video": "https://youtu.be/fXJQ3QUsTdk",
    "Statement": "Hey there!\n\nLet’s dive into the fascinating world of Beckn and how it’s revolutionizing digital commerce.\n\nToday, online transactions usually require buyers & sellers to use centralized marketplaces, limiting access to a few big players.\n\nBeckn changes that with an open, lightweight protocol. It allows buyers and sellers to connect directly through any digital app, without a middleman.\n\nThink of it like email – you can use any provider to send and receive emails. Beckn creates a decentralized, open network for transactions.\n\nWhy Beckn matters you ask? That's a great question.\n\nImagine you own a small grocery store. Normally, only nearby residents would know about your store. But with Beckn, you can publish your catalog online and reach millions using any app. Plus, you can connect with delivery services through Beckn-enabled apps to get your products to customers easily.\n\nFor buyers, this means more convenience. Use one app to find and order anything you need, with clear info on availability and delivery times.\n\nHere's an example to understand how Beckn works.\n\nColgate doesn’t open a store on every street to sell toothpaste. Instead, they ensure their products are available in stores where people already shop. Beckn does the same for online businesses, making products and services available on various apps.\n\nBeckn isn’t just another e-commerce platform. It’s a set of open specifications that give buyers and sellers more freedom to connect and do business online. It’s not an aggregator and doesn’t store user info.\n\nExcited to learn more and be part of this movement? Let’s get started!\n\nIn this milestone we will learn about protocols and standards that enable seamless interaction across diverse systems, aiming for open and scalable solutions.\n\nYou'll discover more about the Beckn Protocol, showcasing open standards for accessible digital networks and network interoperability.",
