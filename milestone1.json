    "problem_statement": "Dive into the world of open networking with this Milestone, where you''ll unravel the concept of open networking as the bedrock of modern digital communication. Through videos and available literature, you will understand how open networks function using open standards and commodity hardware, promoting interoperability and flexibility. You''ll explore various definitions and characteristics of open networking, including the importance of open APIs, industry standards, and open-source components. Discussions will focus on how open networking contrasts with closed systems, and you''ll be introduced to the organizations like the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) that are pioneering these efforts. This journey will demystify the principles of software-defined networking (SDN) and its role in open networks, preparing you to grasp the Beckn Protocol''s place within this landscape.",
