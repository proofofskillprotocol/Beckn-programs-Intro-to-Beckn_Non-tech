  "Milestone 2 - Beckn Protocol - Specification & Architecture": {
    "Intro Video link": "https://youtu.be/vGV_JVdVMBM",
    "Statement": "In this milestone, you will embark on a journey to understand the intricacies of the Beckn Protocol Specification & Architecture. This exploration will include studying the foundational layers of the protocol, such as the Core APIs, Core schema, Domain taxonomy, Communication protocol, and Authentication and Smart Contracts. These components are essential for any platform wishing to be part of the Beckn open network. Learners will delve into the details of the Transaction Layer, where the interactions between Beckn Application Platforms (BAPs), Beckn Provider Platforms (BPPs), and Beckn Gateways (BGs) are choreographed to provide a seamless transaction experience. BAPs are consumer-facing entities that initiate transactions, while BPPs fulfill them by providing services or goods. BGs facilitate the discovery and interaction between BAPs and BPPs, enhancing the network's efficiency. Understanding the roles of these entities will be crucial for grasping the network's functionality. Furthermore, the Registry Infrastructure Layer will be covered, highlighting the importance of open registries that store detailed information about network participants and the process of becoming a recognized subscriber within the network",
