  "Milestone 3 - Beckn Protocol - Building with Beckn": {
    "Intro Video": "https://youtu.be/BnYprcKGMn8",
    "Statement": "Hello again!\n\nNow that you have an understanding of what the parts of Beckn are and how they work, let's dive deep into how you can build amazing experiences and products using the Beckn ecosystem.\n\nWe'll cover the aspects of building BAP, BPPs, working with Beckn Gateways, and then putting all these components together to create new ecosystems and experiences with Beckn.\n\nLet's understand how to build BAPs. This involves creating the consumer-facing side of the Beckn network. Designing intuitive interfaces that allow users to browse services, place orders, and initiate transactions is key. Think of it like building a mobile app for ordering food â€“ the goal is to make the process as seamless and user-friendly as possible.\n\nNext, let's move on to building BPPs. This focuses on the service provider side. The platform will handle the fulfillment of transactions initiated by BAPs. For example, if developing a platform for restaurants, the BPP will manage incoming orders, update inventory, and ensure timely delivery of services. It's all about ensuring that the service providers can efficiently manage their end of the transaction.\n\nNow, let's talk about working with Beckn Gateways. BGs are crucial for ensuring smooth communication between BAPs and BPPs. When building solutions, integrating with BGs is necessary to facilitate the flow of data and ensure that transactions are processed seamlessly. Think of BGs as the bridges that connect different parts of the network, enabling them to work together harmoniously.",
